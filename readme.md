## What the heck is this?
This is a silly 4-hour project that has no specific use and should be considered irrelevant by anyone that lands here for whatever reason.

## Why was it made? Why did you think it was a good idea?
It was made as a way to practice my rusty WebGL skills and refresh some OpenGL-related concepts. I don't think it's a good idea or useful in any way, and no one would ever think that it is something to be proud of, but hey, it's open-source code, so... whatever.
